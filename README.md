# Django WEB Application ConstructionProjectManagement

# Introduction

# The current Django application is based on an idea that arose based on my many years of experience in the investment processes that are carried out during the implementation of construction projects. 
# This is a complex process and there are many participants in it, depending on the category and complexity of the construction, many documents are generated throughout the process from design, approval to its implementation, 
# which is accompanied by many approvals and permits from the state administration. All this requires building a well-structured database that is accessible through the web space, well-arranged with an accessible interface. 
# Currently, the organization of documentation occurs on a server, if you can call it one, in which some employees create folders, and others upload documents without any order and standard for naming folders and files, which greatly complicates the workflow.
# The basic structure of the Django project ConstructionProjectManagement is based on participants in the implementation of an investment project and they are the client/client, 
# designers, builder and construction supervisor/consultant according to the basic law for the implementation of construction activities ZUT. The current Django project is a very basic project that can be used to upgrade to something very large and complex, 
# such as software and have application in the construction business.
# See all to documentation.
